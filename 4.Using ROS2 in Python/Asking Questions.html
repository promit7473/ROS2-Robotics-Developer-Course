<h4>Asking Questions</h4><p>Before we dive into coding, I want to quickly go over how to go about asking questions if you ever get stuck throughout any part of this section. Following the guidelines below will allow me to assist you quicker if you have a question, and help other students out should they have the same question.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h4>What You Should Do Before Posting A Question</h4><p>Most lectures in this section will have downloadable content which contains resources and/or a copy of the code which I went over in that particular lecture. One of the first things you should try to do is download these resources and compare it to your setup for any discrepancies.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h4>Q&amp;A Content Guidelines</h4><ol><li><p>Give a brief description of the problem you are having</p></li><li><p>State what operating system / version you are using (ex: Windows 10, Ubuntu 20)</p></li><li><p>State at what point / timestamp in the video lecture you ran into the issue.</p></li><li><p>State any possible steps you took to try and solve the problem (Example: Did you try to compare your setup to the downloadable resources for that particular lecture?)</p></li><li><p>Upload photo(s), or copy and paste the full error message (including the command you were trying to run)</p></li><li><p>If your error relates to writing / executing your code, please upload photo(s), or copy and paste your full code.</p></li><li><p>If you are running into errors related to compiling your workspace (colcon build), please upload photo(s), or copy and paste your CMaklists.txt and package.xml files in your package.</p></li><li><p>Are you able to run other ROS2 terminal commands properly without any problems? (to check if there is a problem with your ROS2 installation or environment sourcing)</p></li><li><p>Is there anything you did differently than what was shown in the course/lecture? (Example: Are you running the same OS? Are you running the same version of ROS2? Are you running in a virtual machine or did you dual-boot your computer? Did you install things as shown in the course, or did you have to do something slightly different to get something working in previous lectures?</p></li></ol><p><br></p><p><br></p><h4>What To Do After You Have Asked A Question</h4><p>Be sure to check back to see if someone has answered your question. If the answer does not help to resolve your error, be sure to comment back and let the person know you are still running into errors, and describe what you are experiencing. If you find an answer to your own question after asking, go ahead and respond to the question you posted, explaining how you resolved the issue.</p>
