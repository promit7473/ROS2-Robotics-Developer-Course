<p>Hey ROS&nbsp;Developer! </p><p><br></p><p>This is a friendly note that this course currently uses ROS2 Humble on Ubuntu 22.04. </p><p>Ubuntu 22.04 was released this past April and ROS2 Humble (the latest ROS2 LTS distro) was released May 24. For information on this new release, check out my announcement in the "Educational Announcements" tab of the course. </p><p><br></p><p>I have completely updated the course from ROS2 Foxy to ROS2 Humble. Please keep in mind there are a few differences, between the versions, and the way I&nbsp;do some of the course lectures compared to how I&nbsp;had them organized previously. This may lead to problems if you started with ROS2 Foxy and try to follow along with the current video lecture. This include the following:</p><ul><li><p>Parameters Lecture (parameters now include QoS control)</p></li><li><p>The Gazebo Simulation Lecture (Gazebo got reworked/rebranded to "Ignition", so all the commands and UI changed)</p></li><li><p>Compiling Custom SRV files (you now need to include message dependencies explicitly in CMakeList.txt file in a certain format)</p></li><li><p>The default OpenCV candidate for Ubuntu 22.04 is different than it was for Ubuntu 20.04</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>I've left a few of the old lectures near the end of the course, in case they were of any interest to students. </p><p><br></p><p>Keep on developing!</p><p><br></p><p>-Raymond</p>
